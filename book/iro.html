        <p>”Y’all kids gonna miss the bus if you don’t get up”, mama shouts.</p>
        <p>Every morning with the same old thing
        from mama. Were always on time to get ready for the bus. Well, at
        least I am. Yet she still feels the need to yell at us
        from the kitchen. It’s the same routine every day: at 6:30 a.m. I
        wake up, stretch my arms and exercise for 10 minutes because I read
        you become lazy and stiff when you get older if you don’t. I put on
        my school uniform I ironed last night. I sit them by the radiator so
        they still feel warm on my butt when I put them on. It like putting
        on fresh underwear that’s just gotten out of the dryer. After I brush
        my teeth, I read a chapter from A Study in Scarlet by Arthur Conan
        Doyle. I really like the Sherlock Holmes books; since I started, I
        tend to pay attention to peoples body language just as Sherlock does.
        When people fold their arms in certain situations, small biting on
        their nail’s and much more. Francis and I went to the barbershop once
        because he needed his hair cut. Mama insisted that he take me with him
        so I can get out the house a little while. At the barbershop, a lady
        and three boys sat in front of us also waiting to get their hair cut.
        A large man knocks on the window, and the lady steps outside to see him.
        I thought the large man was their father, but I noticed from two of the
        boys expression in the barbers mirror they didn’t like the man very much.
        They sat with their arms folded and a scolding look on their faces.
        The youngest looking boy sat playing with a power ranger toy without
        a care in the world. She stood there talking to him with her arms
        folded and a disgruntled look on her face. They talk for a couple
        minutes and he hands her some money. She still has a sad look on her
        face despite him giving her money.</p>
      </div>
			<div>
        <p>“Mama I’m hungry. When can we go home?” the youngest boy pleads as she walks back into the barbershop.</p>
        <p>“Just be quiet and get your hair cut. We going home and eat once y’all finished. You can’t just go outside looking any kinda way. And Jason and Eli straighten your faces up before I do it for you. I don’t know what either of y’all got an attitude for.” she says to the older boys.</p>
        <p>I’ve seen that same look and body language on mama many times. We’ve driven across the city in pouring rain to see her friend Orlando.</p>
        <p>“Damn bro how much longer we got to sit out her?” Francis says from the front seat.</p>
        <p>My younger sister, Adara is sleeping beside me in the backseat. She always does when it rains. She can’t help it, it’s as if the rain is singing her a lullaby. I can see mama and Orlando standing at an office building entrance and mama looking as if she wants to cry. Her and the lady at the barbershop have the exact same “body language” as Sherlock calls it. From the look on her face: her eyes are dim and sleepy like. She’s fatigued with her shoulders hunched over as she stands leaning up against the wall. I always wondered was it a thing single black mothers did collectively? Do they all have a meeting to discuss their problems and cry together? Moments later, we can see mama running back in the rain from a short distance. “Fucking finally”, Francis mutters.</p>
        <p>“You done talking to your boyfriend or do we wait to go home some more?” Francis says.</p>
      </div>
			<div>
        <p>“Mind your damn business and put your seat belt on.” Mama responds.</p>
        <p>“You always got something to say.”</p>
        <p>“All I ask was can we go home, all that yelling not even necessary”, he says.</p>
        <p>“Again, stop talking and put your seat belt on so we can go.”</p>
      </div>

        <p style="text-align: center;vertical-align: middle;"><b>Chapter 2</b></p>
        <p>I walk up the hall to our bagged lunches mama prepared. “Your brother and sister ready yet?” mama says as I walk in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>“No not yet. But the bus don’t get here for another 30 minutes, so they still got time.”</p>
        <p>“And whats that you reading today? Is is something for school” she says noticing my book in hand out the corner of her eye.</p>
        <p>“Oh it’s the first Sherlock Holmes book. The detective over in Europe
          who can look at people and tell them about they self. And no its not
          for school, I just like it” I respond. I try not to give much detail
          about Sherlock, the books I read, or anything for that matter in hopes
          of not confusing her when I talk like I do most people. I think she
          feels patronized at time, but lets me be.</p>
        <p>“You learning anything new? And, you hope to become some detective or
           something?” she smiles at me. “If you are, that’s good. We need good
           people around this neighborhood that’ll actually serve and protect it.
           You know how police can be these days. They see us[black people]
           especially as the enemy from the jump. Hell, its so many different
           people around this neighborhood, we all struggling. White folks
           included. And everytime something goes wrong, they questions the
           black folks.” I get so bored when she gets to rambling like this.
           Its almost excruciating. No, I don’t want to be a police officer.
           Truthfully, I don’t know what I want to be. I’m just starting 8th
           grade, I don’t have time to think about that right now; I just want
           to read, get my work done, and get this year over with so I’m</p>
      </div>

			<div>
        <p>ready for high school. But I still listen to what she has to say. “You hear
         me Iro?” she says with her hand on her hip. “You zoning out again? I
         told you about that. You think I’m boring or something?”</p>
        <p>“No ma’am.” I mutter.</p>
        <p>“Well thank you. I felt like I was talking to myself for a second there. Now where is Francis and Adara at? The bus is gonna be here soon, and I’m not driving them this time. Run in the other room and get your brother and sister up before I go in there.” I go to the other room to see what’s keeping Francis and Adara, and just as I approach our room, he is coming out. And Adara coming from hers. </p>
        <p>“You know mama, you don’t need to yell every morning. I over slept just that one day.” Francis says.</p>
        <p>“And that was one day to many.” she says, throwing him his brown bagged lunch. She kneels down at Adara handing her a bagged lunch, “and baby are you ready for school? We finally got the paperwork settled so you can start 3rd grade. You a week late, but you gonna learn so much still.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, ma’am.” she responds with a big smile.</p>
        <p>“Now y’all get outside and wait for the bus. It should be here in about 10 more minutes.” as she returns to the kitchen table.</p>
        <p>We each wait for the bus at the bus stop. Francis waits with us because his high school is directly across the street from the middle school. As we wait, I notice Juan and Jesse approaching;</p>

      </div>

			<div>
        <p>they’re cool, but they talk to much. All they talk about is football, and its always awkward when they ask me questions considering I have no interest in sports. But I go with the flow.</p>
        <p>“Yo, Iro, who you got going to the super bowl this season? This goofy really think the Bears gonna do something this year?” Jesse says.</p>
        <p>I respond, “The Bears gonna do what they usually do and get bodied this year like they do every year. They haven’t been even relevent since 2006 when the Colts got in that ass.”</p>
        <p>“Facts!”, Jesse says.</p>
        <p>Juan looks at me with a confused look, “You don’t even play sports so what do you even mean?”</p>
        <p>“No, don’t come at him like that. Bro he talking nothing but truth. Plus, we all know Cowboys finally gonna make something happen.” Jesse rebuttals.</p>
        <p>“You only say that bias shit because you from Texas and they’re the Dallas Cowboys. And you know, just like we know, they gonna get smacked this year like usual.” Juan interrupts.</p>
        <p>I get quiet and put my head down because sports talk usually end in fights. Francis then speaks without looking at any of us, “Y’all middle schools shorties really are annoying these days. The Patriots gonna win, and there really ain’t any debate to that.” Jesse smacks his lips, “Get off Brady sack.” Francis just smiles and keeps looking forward.</p>
        <p>I hate being added to these conversations. Everybody tends</p>
      </div>

        <p>
          to think that just because the majority like something, I do or should
          to with the rest of the ensemble, when in fact, I can’t stand it.
          Hell, I barely listen to rap music now or anything of the sort. My
          best friend Vincent suggests that I overthink things and I should just
          enjoy the music. But it’s hard for me to just give in. I nitpick small
          details especially when it comes to music. For me, rap is all a
          gimmick; switched around adjectives and inserting new metaphors and
          similes. The beat just sounds good. There’s always something about
          money, or women, or killing someone you dislike. I can only listen to
          that kind of self-loathing for so long. Slick Rick the Ruler on the
          other hand is an exception. His music reminds me of a Basquiet
          Painting. Loud as hell, but is as clear as day to certain eyes. I can’t
          explain it. Most rappers just rhyme. Slick Rick paints a picture,
          rhymes, and makes you laugh all in one while giving explicit attention
          to detail. Honestly, he should write a book one day on his writing
          process. Jazz and Classical music are for me. People at the library
          look at me funny when they overhear what I’m listening to through the
          headphones. I don’t play an instrument, but I know what actual
          instruments are being played. Not like in rap now and days where you
          have a mixture of classic Hot Boys and Kurtis Blow. You have southern
          boom boom with 70s boom bap. When I listen to Charlie Parker or Chopin,
          I feel like I can fly. You don’t just listen to Charlie Parker or Chopin
          you feel Charlie Parker and Chopin. I always wondered if that’s the way
          people feel when they listen to rap music? I can relate to rappers when
          they stress how they watched their mothers suffer &amp; struggle financially
          or with addiction. Or how there were some days where they couldn’t eat.
          Mama, Francis, Adara, and I have had those problems. There were times when we also didn’t have
          food to eat, used baking soda to brush our teeth, used the stoves oven
          to keep warm in the winter because mama had to pay the gas bill
        </p>
      </div>

			<div>
        <p>instead of the electricity. Also times where we had to boil pots of
        water on the stove to make hot water to bath in. I can relate to most
        of the traumatic experiences rappers decide to rap about behind all
        the money spending, drug abuse, and women beating. But it just doesn’t
        do it for me the way Charlie Parker or Chopin does. It's all conflicting
        for me. I wonder does it
        hurt some people to know that the endorsement of violence and drug abuse
        is comforting to them. Or that maybe behind the drugs and profanity is
        a cry for help, and a longing to be held by someone?</p>
      </div>

        <p style="text-align: center;vertical-align: middle;"><b>Chapter 3</b></p>
        <p>I sometimes wonder if I were born in the wrong century? But truth be
          told, the last few decades haven’t been too great, especially for black
          people. I’m willing to bet before the 60s, white people were, as black
          people are described today: loud, obnoxious, entitled, or feels that
          the world owes them something. Back then, being white, you could wake
          up in the morning, decide you want to go kill someone just because they
           were black and get away with it just because they were black. And if
           you were to get in actual trouble, you could argue “I only killed a
           negro”, and unsurprisingly the jury would ponder to themselves that
           you might actually have a point. It must have been nice to constantly
           be told you were superior to other people and that the reason they
           were less fortunate was because it was how god intended the world to
           be. But maybe that was just the time? Maybe they simply adapted to
           the current situation of the world they were in. Historically
           speaking, there has never been a time when one people didn’t want
           their own to have a leg up on other people. That’s always been the
           way of the world. I sometimes imagine myself, a now free man,
           standing at a four-way crossroad with my former plantation behind me
           in the distance. The emancipation proclamation was just passed and
           we all are finally free. Life can be good now, I’s don’t have to be
           someone’s property and be sold and have to call some old white man
           “masa” no more. We finally got our freedom, so what’s left for me? I can’t really work anywhere because nobody want negroes in their stores. And I can’t go to school because we colored folks aren’t allowed to learn to read and write. And I’s don’t have no money, so if I want to eat I’s got to steal something. Only thang is, white folks be itching for the first chance they can get to kill a negro. I think theys like doing it. And them confederates, oh lord them
         </p>
      </div>

			<div>
        <p>
          confederates, they like to kill wandering negroes’ with no place to
          go. They feel like we should still be in the fields. Some of us was
          lucky to have learned to read and right, but I wasn’t one of them. Maybe
          I should go back to Africa? I don’t know anybody there, and don’t
          think they kept a book at the auction of where us niggas came from,
          just a price tag. I’m hoping god will come save us soon and punish
          them for they crimes against us. I still wonder what we all do to
          deserve all this? Maybe masa will let me go back and work in the
          fields for a while til I figure this all out. I got to make a decision
          soon, night time is approaching. I wonder where someone like me fits
          in? I acknowledge that I’m not like everyone else: I don’t talk much,
          I don’t listen to rap music, not a big fan of sports, I like to read,
          and I have a giant head of hair that, no matter how many times I get
          it cut, it grows back between two days and a whole week. Where do I
          fit in the worlds timeline to the point of today? Sadly for the rest
          of my life, I have no choice but to ask that question repeatedly.
          Juan, Jesse, and other kids in the neighborhood just go with the flow.
          They never fight the current or surf it to find a better path. Or
          even ask questions about why things are how they are. It’s as if the
          entire community is a marionette stringed with a basketball, a welfare
          check, or a microphone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bus is arriving in the distance, and thank god. Conversation
          all together generally tones down when the bus is coming up until
          it arrives in front of us. It only lasts for about a minute, but
          temporary happiness is a bitch. We step on to the bus, and the
          sports conversation briefly continues, “I still think y’all full of
          shit. The Bears is definitely making noise this year. On god. Even
          if it’s just the playoffs.” says Juan.
        </p>
        <p>“Man, move around with all that.” Jesse interrupts.</p>
      </div>
      
			<div>
        <p>I move on to the back of the bus following Juan and Jesse. They sit in the last 2 seats and I two seats up from them. Francis sits in the front every day because being that he is older, he thinks he shouldn’t associate with anyone who is in middle school considering he’s a sophomore now. Which struct me as odd considering everyone in the neighborhood knows each other and can’t nobody hold water. The smallest thing will send off a smoke signal and have everyone talking. So truthfully, what difference is there? Adara usually talks to her friends in the seat behind Francis. It’s the same routine every day. The bus ride lasts about 15 minutes. Our school is small and big at the same time. It goes from kindergarten to 8th grade, and most classrooms contain more than twenty students. Some even mix grades in the same class. The 4th graders on one side and 5th on the other. And we have no classes that would be categorized as “the arts”, so I’m constantly bored out of my mind. I think that constitutes to why my teachers have a love hate relationship with me. They appreciate someone who is driven to learn, and resists acting foolishly with the rest of the class, but they hate to be sassed, told they’re wrong, or simply disagreed with in any way. </p>
