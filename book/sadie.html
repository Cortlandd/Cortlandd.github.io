        <p>I always wondered why everyone stayed to socialize after school was over? Waiting after school for the bus to come is always dull. Everyone around me is excited, while I stand exhausted ready for my bus ride nap. It could be that I'm a senior now and the former joy of socializing with everyone simply doesn't appeal to me anymore. I can't really complain considering I'm the bus drivers last stop every day.</p>
        <p>"Yo, Iro, what's the word?", I hear from a distance.</p>
        <p>"Nothing much" I reply. "Waiting for this dry ass bus to come. What you on this weekend Quice? You and Donnie making that move to that party tonight?"</p>
        <p>"Oh most definitely" Quice replies.</p>
        <p>"You sliding to?" he continues.</p>
        <p>"No, I got some stuff going on this weekend. Relatives coming in, and everything to." I lie.</p>
        <p>"All good bro. But before the year over with, you definitely gotta smoke with us."</p>
        <p>"Most definitely bro" Donnie steps in. "Bruh we been waiting to see you high as hell for a minute. You gotta come kick it with us."</p>
        <p>I never understand their reasons for wanting to see me unstable. Hell, I never understood their reason for smoking in general. They always argue it's to get away from reality for</p>
      </div>
      <!-- Page 2 -->
      <div>
        <p>a while or just to chill out, but I escape reality everyday while standing at this boring bus stop. And I'm always chilled out; I avoid conflict with people all the time and I barely talk to people unless I'm really cool with them or there is a female who catches my attention. I respond "Nah bro. If I could I would. But moms got me helping her with some stuff this weekend."</p>
        <p>"You flexing bro" Donnie insists.</p>
        <p>"But it's all good." he adds</p>
        <p>The bus arrives and I've never been more excited to see it. The conversation about making me into a drug addict usually pro longs for a while. I don't understand how they've not gotten the hint that partying and a lot of socializing really doesn't do it for me. I just adapt and say things so people won't talk to me as much and only expect me to talk. But only in my head does the equation make sense. We navigate to the back of the bus to our usual seats. I sit 2 seats up from the last seat on the left with Quice and Donnie at the last 2 seats. People on the bus are usually talkative which is why I prepare my bookbag as a pillow for my bus ride nap so people don't talk to me, but something catches my attention. There appears to be a new girl on the bus. I hadn't  seen her on the bus previously; she's short and has thighs like she was raised in the south. I always dug that. And she sports a really hippy jacket and bookbag with a bunch of writing on it. Plus, her lips are almost the size of mine for a white girl. She walks past me to the seat behind me and sits.</p>
        <p>"So Sadie how do you like the school so far?", Quice says loudly.</p>

      <!-- Page 3 -->
      <div>
        <p>"Who the fuck is Sadie?" I say under my breath.</p>
        <p>"It's ok. Everyone's all snobby, and guys keep trying to</p>
        <p>hit on me" she laughs.</p>
        <p>"Oh that's cool. Where did you say you were from before you came here?"</p>
        <p>"Yeah I'm from North Carolina. My parents got new job here and everything so we moved this way." she replies shrugging her shoulders.</p>
        <p>"Oh that's whats up" Quice replies. "Do you smoke by any chance?"</p>
        <p>"Yeah a little bit, but not really."</p>
        <p>"We definitely should smoke one of these days" Quice continues as the bus is pulling off.</p>
        <p>I take my book bag off and make my way to the back beside Quice. "Bruh who fuck is shorty?"</p>
        <p>"Oh she's new bruh. Been here for like a week now."</p>
        <p>"How come I haven't seen her?" I reply confused.</p>
        <p>"I don't know bruh. I think its her first time on the bus. Why?"</p>
        <p>"This bitch fine, why didn't anybody tell me about her?"</p>

      </div>
      <!-- Page 4-->
      <div>
        <p>"She new so nobody really know her like that. But got for it" he says.</p>
        <p>I return to my seat and take my usual nap, but not without uncommon and unwanted issues. Being that I sleep with my head on the window, I am restless, and each time I open my eyes I can see Sadie from the windows reflection caused by the sun; shes is deeply intuned into her phone. There is a weird feeling in my stomach I've never had before with each time I look at her. And its lasts for about 10 minutes before I finally manage to nod off to sleep.</p>
        <p>When the bus drops me off at home, I rush to the kitchen for a quick snack so I can finish homework early and take another nap. My after school Fridays and Saturdays are all the same every weekend. I read, sleep, eat, and repeat the process. Sunday comes around and its usually the time I take to ponder on school to make sure I did all the work I needed to. But then I remember Sadie getting on the bus, walking to the sit with headphones in her ear. There really isn't anything more cruel than memory. Especially unwanted memories. They're like roaches climbing into your food, except there's another one no matter how clean or where you choose to eat. This particular memory is one of Sadie. I technically haven't actually met her, only seen her; all I have is her beautiful laugh in my head and an image of that rough olive green jacket she wears. My gut clings to know more about her; to know how she thinks, what she likes to read, what her favorite color is, everything.</p>
